# Custom-positions


Developing a routine to produce HCS sites from slide based arrays.

Uses 2 positions for calibration.

Takes acount of sample twist in x-y.

User marks top left and top right and routine computes all other positions. no GUI at the moment, user must add in numbe rof sites.

This will not work for block arrays like ChemoTC
